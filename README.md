Heuristiekenproject Protein Pow(d)er

This program uses an alogritm to calculate the optimal folding in a protein. The protein consists of polar (P) and hydrophocic (H)
amino acids. The amino acids are folded into a 2D array configuration. Two adjecent H amino acids which are not bondend to each other
result in a stabilizing 'H-bond'. The amount of 'H-bonds' quantifies how well the stabilization is. This program outputs the optimal
configurations with stabilization of a given input protein strand.
